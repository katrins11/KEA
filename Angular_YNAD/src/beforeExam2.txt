I GOT IN MY FIRST EXAM:
- Web Servece
- Optimacation
- Deepfreze

In crud.service.ts:
    //WHAT IS Observable<any> DO?
    //WHY DO WE PUT THE SUBSCRIBE HERE BUT NOT IN THE GET?
    //WHAT DOES THE SUBSCRIBE DO?

In allUsers.component.ts
    //wHAT DOES THE OnInit DO?
    //WHAT  DOES THE SUBSCRIPE DO?
    //IN WHAT ORDER DOES IT PRIENT OUT?

Optimacation
    How would we optimice our code and what would we do / how would we do it?

Lazy Load
    //How does the lazyload work, know that it is put in the routing and in the app.module
    //Implement Lazy Loading.

Deepfreze
    //Make deepfreze that works
    //Implement DeepFreeze.



ANNE MAI GOT THIS:
End2End
    //Make more E2E tests
    //Test where somthing is put in the input, and more.

Unit test
    //Make more Unit tests
    //Learn how to create new unit test if we get asked to live code.
    //Test input properly, count how many users are displayed, put value into input, count how many there are after. 
    //Learn how to pass values in the unit test

REDUX
    //Look more into redux, 
    //Maybe implement it somewhere else,
        //Maybe on users.



COMMENT EVERYTHING - Create copy of code.

//BIRNA
REDUX
    //Line 19 in the epic, where is it getting the info? What does each word mean?
    //Go through the redux and  the unit test for the reducer.    

UNIT TEST ON REDUCER ON Deepfreze
    //What is the difference exactly with the tassign and deepfreeze? 
    
E2E

PERFORMANCE
    //How would you do the lazyload.
    //In performance how can you optimise the javascript? (Not -aot -prod - lazyload)
