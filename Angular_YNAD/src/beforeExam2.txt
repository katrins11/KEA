    //WHAT IS Observable<any> DO?
    //WHY DO WE PUT THE SUBSCRIBE HERE BUT NOT IN THE GET?
    //WHAT DOES THE SUBSCRIBE DO?

In allUsers.component.ts
    //wHAT DOES THE OnInit DO?
    //WHAT  DOES THE SUBSCRIPE DO?
    //IN WHAT ORDER DOES IT PRIENT OUT?

Optimacation
    How would we optimice our code and what would we do / how would we do it?

    //Implement Lazy Loading.

Deepfreze
    //Make deepfreze that works
    //Implement DeepFreeze.



ANNE MAI GOT THIS:
End2End
    //Make more E2E tests
    //Test where somthing is put in the input, and more.

Unit test
    //Make more Unit tests
    //Learn how to create new unit test if we get asked to live code.
    //Test input properly, count how many users are displayed, put value into input, count how many there are after. 
    //Learn how to pass values in the unit test

REDUX
    //Look more into redux, 
    //Maybe implement it somewhere else,
        //Maybe on users.



COMMENT EVERYTHING - Create copy of code.
